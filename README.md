## About the Video Course
This course is a really comprehensive guide to the Google Cloud Platform - it has ~20 hours of content and ~60 demos. The Google Cloud Platform is not currently the most popular cloud offering out there - that's AWS of course - but it is possibly the best cloud offering for high-end machine learning applications. That's because TensorFlow, the super-popular deep learning technology is also from Google.
